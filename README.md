# Coding Math
A repo for me to practise coding math.
The main reference of this repo is from [this YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath). Most of the content here are similar to the author's, but I did further extend some code and added my own implementations, such as quadrilateralIntersect and cubicBezierIntersect.
