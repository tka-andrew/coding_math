# Trigonometry
- Normally we are more familiar with **Cartesian Coordinate System**:
    - towards East is positive x
    - towards North is positive y
- However, in **computer screens**, the coordinate is different:
    - towards East is still positive x
    - towards South is positive y
- In Math, normally how we measures angle is: 
    - East -> North -> West -> South
- However, since we swapped the y axis, now in computer screen it will be:
    - East -> North -> West -> South
- 360 degree = 2 pi
